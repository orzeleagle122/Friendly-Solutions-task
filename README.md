# Friendly Solutions - code task

### Description

- We have included json data snapshot on the bottom of that file. It includes the example of work orders data we process everyday.
- Take 10 minutes to become familiar with the content of the json data before beginning with the tasks and bonus items.
- You should not spend more than 90-120 minutes on this task. The bonus items are extended goal tasks.
- You can use (but you do not need to) MobX or Redux for state management.

### Tasks

1. Initialize React web app project with TypeScript

2. Wrap JSON in Promise and imitiate fetching from remote API

3. Create a screen with table including the following information:

    - WO ID
    - Description
    - Received date
    - Assigned to
    - Status
    - Priority

4. Add types with TypeScript

5. Do a simple styling with flexbox (just to show that you know how it works in case of using it then in React Native)

6. Create a simple README.md with install / usage instructions

### Bonus

1. Search input to search for work orders by description
2. Use custom hooks

There are no right or wrong solutions for this task. Once complete, create a public repo on Github and email us with your solution.
